The holidays bring joy, connection, and celebration, but they also bring more stress, more food,
less sleep, more emotions, and way less structure.****So if you find yourself eating more sweets,
grazing all day, or feeling “out of control” around food, it’s not a character flaw or a lack of
discipline. It’s your nervous system doing the best it can with limited capacity and high demand.
Think of it more as biology, stress, and your environment rather than a lack of willpower.

Below is a simple, step-by-step checklist you can use anytime emotional eating pops up. Think of it
as a gentle interruption, not a rulebook, to help you reconnect with your body and your values or
goals when things feel chaotic.

## 1. Pause & Breathe

Before anything else, take a moment to slow your body down. Emotional eating often happens in
milliseconds – you feel something uncomfortable, your brain wants relief, and food becomes the
fastest fix.

A 30–120 second pause interrupts that loop.

Why it works:****Deep breathing activates your parasympathetic system, lowering cortisol and
reducing the intensity of an urge. Slowing down gives the thinking part of your brain (the
prefrontal cortex) a chance to come back online.

How to do it:

- 5 slow belly breaths
- Hand on heart + long, slow exhale
- Inhale for 4 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds

A pause doesn’t eliminate the urge; it just gives you space to choose what comes next.

## 2. The HALT Check

HALT stands for Hungry, Angry/Anxious, Lonely, Tired – the four states most linked to emotional
eating.

Why it works: Emotional eating is often a misdirected attempt to meet an emotional or physical need.
HALT helps you identify what that need actually is.

Ask yourself:

- Am I physically hungry?
- Am I angry, anxious, or stressed?
- Am I feeling lonely, disconnected, or needing comfort?
- Am I tired, overstimulated, or mentally drained?

If hunger is low, emotional needs are probably high, and food won’t fix those needs.

## 3. Name the Emotion

Once you identify the feeling, say it out loud or in your head.

Why it works: Labeling emotions reduces their intensity. This is a well-documented psychological
effect known as “affect labeling.” When you name the emotion, your brain automatically shifts from
reaction mode to regulation mode.

Examples:

- “I’m feeling overwhelmed and tapped out.”
- “I’m lonely and needing comfort.”
- “I’m stressed and overstimulated.”

Remember, you’re not judging the emotion, you’re just acknowledging it.

## 4. Create an Acceptance Moment

Instead of fighting the craving or shaming yourself, practice acceptance. This comes from ACT
(Acceptance & Commitment Therapy).

Why it works: Resistance makes urges stronger. Acceptance reduces their power.

Try saying:

- “This craving is a signal, not an emergency.”
- “I can feel this emotion without using food to numb it.”
- “My body is asking for comfort, and I can decide how to respond.”

You’re permitting yourself to feel without needing to fix.

## 5. Interoception Check-In

Interoception is your ability to sense internal cues like hunger, fullness, or emotional tension.
Observe your body’s signals: Growling stomach, low energy, lightheadedness, or irritability are
physical signs of hunger. Cravings without these signs may be emotional or boredom-driven.

Why it works: Many people confuse emotional discomfort with hunger because both come from the same
area of the body (the gut and chest).

Rate your hunger from 0–10:

- 0–4: likely emotional or boredom-driven
- 5–7: genuine hunger
- 8–10: you may have waited too long to eat

This step teaches you to interpret what your body is truly asking for.

## 6. Choose a Non-Food Coping Strategy

Once you know what you’re feeling, choose a small action that meets that need more directly than
food.

**If it’s boredom:**

Food provides stimulation (especially sugar). Replace the stimulation instead of eating to fill
time.

Try:

- Step outside for a change of environment
- Switch rooms to reset your brain
- Text a friend for a quick connection
- Do a 2-minute household task
- Engage in a valued activity: reading, stretching, cuddling your kids, folding laundry, journaling

Why it works: Boredom often comes from low dopamine and mental under-stimulation. Changing your
environment or doing a small task boosts dopamine and reduces the urge to “eat for something to do.”

**If it’s emotional overwhelm:**

Food is often used as a numbing or grounding tool. Instead, support your nervous system.

Try:

- 5-4-3-2-1 sensory grounding (name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel, 3 things you can
hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste or your favorite taste)
- Deep breathing
- Shake out physical tension
- Hug your partner or pet
- Sit in a quiet room for 60 seconds
- Put your hands in warm water

Why it works: These strategies regulate your nervous system, helping your body shift from “fight-or-
flight” to “rest-and-digest.” When your physiology changes, the need to self-soothe with food
naturally decreases.

## 7. Practice “Urge Surfing”

Urge surfing is a mindfulness technique that teaches you to ride the wave of a craving.

How it works: Instead of reacting to the urge, you observe it like a wave – notice it rise, peak,
and fall.

Why it works: Most cravings only last 5–20 minutes if you don’t feed them with attention or
resistance. Surfing the urge teaches you that urges are temporary, not emergencies.

## 8. If You’re Actually Hungry, Eat a Balanced Snack

If your hunger rating was 5 or higher, your body needs nourishment.

Choose snacks that help stabilize:

- Apple + almond butter
- Veggies + hummus
- Roasted edamame
- Turkey roll-ups + veggies
- Dairy-free yogurt + berries + flax
- Nuts + pear or apple
- Tuna packet + whole-grain crackers

Why it works: Protein + fiber stabilizes blood sugar, which reduces future cravings and prevents the
“eat → crash → crave → repeat” cycle.

## 9. End with Self-Compassion

No matter what happens, whether you ate or didn’t, end with kindness.

Try:

- “I’m human, and this moment doesn’t define me.”
- “My body and emotions are giving me information, not shame.”
- “I’m learning skills, not aiming for perfection.”

Why it works: Self-compassion is one of the strongest predictors of reduced emotional eating long-
term. Punishment actually increases emotional eating; compassion interrupts the cycle.

## Why This Matters So Much During the Holidays

The holiday season creates the perfect storm for emotional eating. We’re surrounded by more food,
especially nostalgic, tasty treats- while also navigating more stress, more emotion, less sleep, and
far less structure. Social expectations ramp up, routines disappear, and old memories or family
dynamics can stir up triggers we weren’t expecting. Add in the quiet pressure of “I should be happy
right now,” and it’s no wonder our capacity to regulate feels lower, and our urge to cope with food
feels higher.

So if you find yourself eating more sweets, grazing mindlessly, or feeling less in control than
usual, it’s not a sign of weakness. It’s a sign that your nervous system is overwhelmed by an
environment that demands more than it gives back. What matters most isn’t perfection, especially not
this time of year. What matters is having a gentle way to interrupt the cycle with awareness,
compassion, and tools that support you rather than punish you.

Give yourself permission to be human this season—messy, emotional, joyful, tired, imperfect, and
still completely worthy of care! Wishing you moments of calm, joyful nourishment, and mindful
presence throughout the season.
