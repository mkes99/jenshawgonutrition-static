excerpt: "If you\u2019ve ever felt overwhelmed by the overabundance of conflicting health and wellness advice out there\u2014one day a food is \u201csuper,\u201d and the next it\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d and to be avoided at all costs (insert eyeroll here!)\u2014you\u2019re not alone. My goal with this blog is to help you cut through the noise and get back to the basics: evidence-based, trustworthy nutrition information that actually makes sense for real life."
