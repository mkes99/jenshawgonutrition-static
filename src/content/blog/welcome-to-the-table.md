## Hi friends, and welcome! I’m so glad you’re here.

If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by the overabundance of conflicting health and wellness advice out there—one day a food is “super,” and the next it’s “toxic” and to be avoided at all costs (insert eyeroll here!)—you’re not alone. My goal with this blog is to help you cut through the noise and get back to the basics: evidence-based, trustworthy nutrition information that actually makes sense for real life.

But before we dive in, let me share a little about myself. I’m Jen, a board-certified nutrition professional who is passionate about helping people feel their best and live more life through practical, evidence-based strategies. When I’m not working with clients or digging into research, you’ll usually find me surrounded by my collection of houseplants, hanging out with my three dachshunds, or enjoying a really good meal (because yes—I love food too!).

This blog is not about perfection. The photos won’t always be polished, the recipes won’t always look “Pinterest-ready,” and I don’t pretend to be a blogging or social media expert. What I do promise is to show up as a real person who cares deeply about your health and to focus on sharing high-quality, evidence-based information you can trust.

Here, you’ll find conversations and resources on topics like:

- Eating for optimal health and wellness  
- Simple, delicious recipes you’ll actually want to make  
- Healthy aging and supporting long-term vitality  
- Practical guidance for managing common conditions  
- Tips for living well without unnecessary stress or restriction  

Think of this space as us sitting down together at the table, sorting through what’s real, what’s hype, and what can help you live a healthier, happier life—without the pressure of perfection.

I can’t wait to share ideas, answer your questions, and connect with you along the way. So grab a cup of coffee (or tea), maybe a dog (or other furry creature you adore) to curl up with, and let’s start this journey together!

Make sure you check out [How to Build Balanced Meals for Health](/how-to-build-balanced-meals-for-health). This will provide you with a solid foundation for understanding how to assemble meals that truly nourish your body and support your health goals. Think of it as our starting point—the basics we’ll keep building on as we explore more topics together!

Here’s to good food, good health, and good conversation.
