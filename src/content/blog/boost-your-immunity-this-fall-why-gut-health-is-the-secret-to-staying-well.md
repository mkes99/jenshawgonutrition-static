The back-to-school season has a way of sneaking up on us. One minute it’s late-summer barbecues, and the next, we’re stocking up on hand sanitizer and tissues. As schedules get busier, kids (and adults) are spending more time indoors, and as the air gets cooler, we officially enter what many call “sick season.” Fall and winter naturally bring more exposure to germs, less sunshine (hello, lower vitamin D), and more stress on routines. Supporting your immune system *before* illness hits makes all the difference — it’s easier to prevent than to play catch-up.

This is the time of year when your immune system deserves some extra love. And the best place to start? Your gut.

## **Gut Health and Immunity: The Connection You Can’t Ignore**

About 70% of your immune system lives in your gut. That means the trillions of microbes in your digestive tract are not just busy helping you digest food — they’re training your immune cells, calming unnecessary inflammation, and helping your body know when it’s time to fight off invaders.

When your gut health is strong, your immune system is more balanced. When it’s struggling, you may be more prone to illness, fatigue, or even those “I just can’t shake this” lingering bugs.

## **Immune-Boosting Foods**

Building a resilient immune system doesn’t have to be complicated. It’s about making consistent choices that nourish your gut and keep your body ready to respond when an invader strikes. Here are some easy ways to get started:

### **1. Eat the Rainbow (and Load Up on Fiber)**

Fiber is your gut bacteria’s favorite food! When you feed them well, they produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that calm inflammation and strengthen your gut lining. The more variety you eat, the stronger and more diverse your microbiome becomes.

**Ideas to try:**

* Add spinach or kale and a tablespoon of chia seeds to morning smoothies.
* Roast a tray of colorful veggies (carrots, bell peppers, zucchini, beets) and keep them in the fridge for easy add-ins or a quick side dish.
* Choose whole grains like quinoa, brown rice, or whole rolled oats for extra fiber.
* Snack on apples, pears, or berries with nut butter for a combo of fiber and healthy fats

### **2. Add Fermented Foods**

Fermented foods naturally contain probiotics, which can support a healthier balance of gut bacteria. Regular intake has been linked to better immune responses and fewer respiratory infections.

**Ideas to try:**

* Sauerkraut or kimchi as a side dish, salad topper, or even in tacos or on top of your morning eggs.
* Kefir or unsweetened yogurt (look for “live active cultures” on the label). If you’re dairy-free, try almond, cashew, oat, or coconut yogurts with added probiotics.
* Miso paste in soups, sauces or marinades.
* Tempeh which is a protein-rich, fermented soy option works well in stir-fries.
* If fermented foods aren’t your thing, a quality probiotic supplement can help fill the gap.

### **3. Choose Healthy Fats**

Healthy fats help your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), all of which are key for immunity. They also support the structure of your cell membranes — your body’s first line of defense.

**Ideas to try:**

* Drizzle olive oil over roasted vegetables.
* Smash avocado onto gluten-free toast or add to salads. Hint: avocado is also a great source of fiber.
* Snack on a small handful of walnuts, almonds, or pumpkin seeds.
* Use chia or flaxseeds in overnight oats or smoothies for an omega-3 boost.
* Fatty fish like salmon, sardines, or anchovies are rich in omega-3’s. For those avoiding fish, consider adding an omega-3 supplement.

### **4. Prioritize Protein**

Your immune system can’t build infection-fighting cells and antibodies without adequate protein. Spreading protein throughout the day (rather than just at dinner) helps your body use it more efficiently.

**Ideas to try:**

* Grilled chicken, turkey, or lean beef added to grain bowls or soups.
* Lentils, chickpeas, or black beans in salads, stews, or wraps.
* Plant or whey-based protein powders in smoothies.
* Hard-boiled eggs or edamame as quick snacks.
* Collagen peptides added to coffee or tea for an easy protein boost.

### **5. Stay Hydrated**

Hydration keeps mucous membranes in your nose, throat, and lungs moist — and those membranes are your immune system’s “sticky traps” for germs. Even mild dehydration can weaken this defense.

**Ideas to try:**

* Aim for half your body weight in ounces of water daily.
* Add lemon, cucumber, or berries to water if plain water feels boring.
* Warm herbal teas like ginger, chamomile, or peppermint can be soothing *and* hydrating.
* Include water-rich foods like cucumbers, citrus, and melons.

### **6. Support With Supplements**

While food is the foundation, sometimes diet alone doesn’t cover everything — especially during busy or stressful seasons. Certain nutrients have been consistently shown to support immunity and gut health. And when illness does strike? Having the right tools on hand — from probiotics to zinc lozenges — can help shorten the duration and get you back to feeling yourself again, sooner.

* **Vitamin D3:** Especially in fall/winter months when sun exposure is low.
* **Vitamin C:** Helpful during times of stress or illness; citrus and peppers are food sources, but supplements can help.
* **Zinc lozenges:** Can reduce the duration of colds when taken at the first sign of symptoms.
* **Probiotics:** Look for strains like *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium*, which are most studied for immune support.
* **Omega-3s:** From fish oil or algae oil to help regulate inflammation.

I’ve put together a collection in my [Fullscript Dispensary](https://us.fullscript.com/plans/jshawgo-immune-essentials) of my go-to immune essentials that I recommend for daily support and what I like to keep on hand for those “I feel something coming on” moments. It’s the wellness version of having a stocked pantry!

## **Bottom Line: Build Resilience Through Gut Health**

There’s no magic bullet for staying healthy this season, but building a strong gut-immune connection sets you up for resilience. Focus on nourishing foods, consistent lifestyle habits, and targeted supplements when needed. Your immune system will thank you — and so will everyone else in your household when you *don’t* pass around the same cold three times.
