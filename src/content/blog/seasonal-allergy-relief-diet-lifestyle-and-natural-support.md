Fall is a beautiful season, but for many people, it also brings sneezing, itchy eyes, congestion,
and fatigue. These symptoms are often due to seasonal allergies, also known as hay fever or allergic
rhinitis. While medications can help, diet, lifestyle, and select supplements complement traditional
medications and may reduce the intensity of symptoms and improve overall quality of life.

This guide will help you understand what seasonal allergies are, their common symptoms, and how
nutrition and natural strategies can support your body during allergy season.

## What Are Seasonal Allergies?

Seasonal allergies are an immune response to environmental triggers like pollen, mold spores, and
grasses. When your body perceives these particles as harmful, it releases histamine from MAST cells,
causing sneezing, congestion, watery eyes, and itching, among other common symptoms.

Although common allergens vary by location, typical allergy seasons include:

- Spring (March–April): Tree pollen
- Summer (June–July): Grass pollen
- Fall (August–October): Ragweed and mold spores

Some people react only in one season, while others struggle year-round due to multiple triggers.

## Signs and Symptoms of Seasonal Allergies

If you’re sensitive to seasonal allergens, you may experience:

- Runny or itchy nose
- Sneezing
- Watery or swollen eyes
- Hives, rashes, or itchy skin
- Nasal congestion and post-nasal drip
- Coughing or sore throat
- Headaches and fatigue

## Why Do Seasonal Allergies Happen?

The histamine response is central to allergy symptoms. Histamine, released from mast cells and
basophils, triggers inflammation, swelling, and mucus production.

Some individuals have a harder time clearing histamine, leading to symptom “overload.” This can be
influenced by:

- Genetics
- Liver detoxification capacity
- Gut microbiome diversity

Emerging evidence shows that people with allergic rhinitis often have **reduced gut microbial
diversity**. This ties into the hygiene hypothesis: reduced exposure to microbes (due to less
farming, fewer siblings, more antibiotics, sterile living) may leave the immune system unbalanced
and more prone to allergies.

## Lifestyle Foundations for Allergy Relief

Even before diet changes, these lifestyle habits can reduce allergen exposure:

- Check pollen counts and avoid outdoor activities during peak times.
- Keep windows closed and use HEPA filters indoors.
- Wash bedding weekly in hot water.
- Shower and change clothes after being outdoors
- Rinse nasal passages with saline to clear allergens from airways.

## Therapeutic Diet for Seasonal Allergies

Food is one of the most powerful tools for reducing inflammation and histamine overload. Focusing on
foods that are both anti-inflammatory and low-histamine can be the key to reducing inflammation,
maintaining a healthy microbiome, and lowering histamine overload.

### Anti-Inflammatory, Low-Histamine Foods to Eat

(Support immune regulation, reduce oxidative stress, and promote histamine clearance)
