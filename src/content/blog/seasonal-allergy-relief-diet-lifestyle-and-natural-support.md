Fall is a beautiful season, but for many people, it also brings sneezing, itchy eyes, congestion, and fatigue. These symptoms are often due to seasonal allergies, also known as hay fever or allergic rhinitis. While medications can help, diet, lifestyle, and select supplements complement traditional medications and may reduce the intensity of symptoms and improve overall quality of life.

This guide will help you understand what seasonal allergies are, their common symptoms, and how nutrition and natural strategies can support your body during allergy season.

## **What Are Seasonal Allergies?**

Seasonal allergies are an immune response to environmental triggers like pollen, mold spores, and grasses. When your body perceives these particles as harmful, it releases histamine from MAST cells, causing sneezing, congestion, watery eyes, and itching, among other common symptoms.

Although common allergens vary by location, typical allergy seasons include:

* Spring (March–April): Tree pollen
* Summer (June–July): Grass pollen
* Fall (August–October): Ragweed and mold spores

Some people react only in one season, while others struggle year-round due to multiple triggers.

## **Signs and Symptoms of Seasonal Allergies**

If you’re sensitive to seasonal allergens, you may experience:

* Runny or itchy nose
* Sneezing
* Watery or swollen eyes
* Hives, rashes, or itchy skin
* Nasal congestion and post-nasal drip
* Coughing or sore throat
* Headaches and fatigue

## **Why Do Seasonal Allergies Happen?**

The histamine response is central to allergy symptoms. Histamine, released from mast cells and basophils, triggers inflammation, swelling, and mucus production.

Some individuals have a harder time clearing histamine, leading to symptom “overload.” This can be influenced by:

* Genetics
* Liver detoxification capacity
* Gut microbiome diversity

Emerging evidence shows that people with allergic rhinitis often have **reduced gut microbial diversity**. This ties into the hygiene hypothesis: reduced exposure to microbes (due to less farming, fewer siblings, more antibiotics, sterile living) may leave the immune system unbalanced and more prone to allergies.

## **Lifestyle Foundations for Allergy Relief**

Even before diet changes, these lifestyle habits can reduce allergen exposure:

* Check pollen counts and avoid outdoor activities during peak times.
* Keep windows closed and use HEPA filters indoors.
* Wash bedding weekly in hot water.
* Shower and change clothes after being outdoors
* Rinse nasal passages with saline to clear allergens from airways.

## **Therapeutic Diet for Seasonal Allergies**

Food is one of the most powerful tools for reducing inflammation and histamine overload. Focusing on foods that are both anti-inflammatory and low-histamine can be the key to reducing inflammation, maintaining a healthy microbiome, and lowering histamine overload.

### **Anti-Inflammatory, Low-Histamine Foods to Eat**

(Support immune regulation, reduce oxidative stress, and promote histamine clearance)

**Vegetables:**

* Zucchini
* Broccoli
* Carrots
* Cauliflower
* Sweet potatoes
* Beets
* Cucumbers
* Romaine, arugula, kale
* Bell peppers
* Green beans

**Fruits:**

* Apples
* Pears
* Blueberries
* Raspberries
* Blackberries
* Mango
* Watermelon
* Pomegranate
* Kiwi

**Other beneficial additions:**

* Herbal teas (nettle, chamomile, rooibos)
* Fresh, unprocessed whole grains (oats, rice, millet, buckwheat, quinoa)

**Proteins:**

* Fresh chicken, turkey, and lamb
* White fish (cod, halibut, haddock), wild caught salmon
* Pasture raised eggs
* Plant proteins: lentils, quinoa, hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds

**Fats:**

* Extra virgin olive oil
* Flaxseeds
* Chia seeds
* Avocado oil (though avocado fruit itself is moderate histamine, the refined oil is low)

**Herbs + Spices:**

* Turmeric
* Ginger
* Basil
* Parsley
* Thyme
* Rosemary
* Oregano

### **High-Histamine, Inflammatory Foods to Limit During Allergy Season**

(Promote histamine release, mast cell activation, or systemic inflammation)

**Aged / Fermented foods:**

* Sauerkraut, kimchi, kombucha
* Soy sauce, miso, tempeh
* Aged cheese
* Yogurt, kefir
* Vinegar-containing condiments

**Cured / Processed meats:**

* Bacon, salami, pepperoni, smoked fish
* Leftover meats or fish (histamine increases as food sits)

**Beverages:**

* Alcohol (especially red wine, beer, champagne)
* Fermented teas (kombucha, black tea)

**Produce high in histamine or histamine-liberators:**

* Tomatoes
* Avocados
* Spinach
* Eggplant
* Mushrooms
* Citrus fruits (especially oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit)
* Strawberries

**Inflammatory fats / processed foods:**

* Refined vegetable oils (canola, corn, soybean)
* Fried foods
* Ultra-processed snacks, baked goods
* Added sugars and artificial sweeteners

## **Best Supplements for Seasonal Allergy Relief**

Supporting the body’s natural defenses with targeted nutrients can help ease symptoms of seasonal allergies and reduce inflammation. Below is a summary of the best-researched nutrients for supporting seasonal allergies:

* **Quercetin** – A flavonoid with natural antihistamine and anti-inflammatory properties. Clinical have shown reduced allergy symptoms with minimal side effects. It works by stabilizing mast cells and decreasing histamine release.
* **Nettles** **(Urtica dioica)** – Traditionally used for allergy relief due to its anti-inflammatory effects.
* **Vitamin D** – Deficiency in vitamin D has been linked to worsened allergy symptoms. Supplementation has been shown to improve allergic rhinitis in deficient individuals. Focus on optimizing vitamin D levels year round.
* **Zinc** – An important immune modulator that can help reduce inflammatory responses.
* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA)** – Omega-3s help reduce airway inflammation and may lessen allergy severity.
* **N-Acetylcysteine** **(NAC)** – Known for antioxidant and mucolytic benefits, NAC supports respiratory health and may help with congestion.
* **Ginger** **(Zingiber officinalis)** – A natural anti-inflammatory shown in clinical studies to be as effective as loratadine (Claritin) in reducing nasal symptoms—without side effects like fatigue or dizziness.
* **DAO (Diamine Oxidase)** – If histamine intolerance worsens seasonal allergies, DAO supplements can support histamine breakdown when taken before meals.
* **Vitamin C** – A potent antioxidant that supports immune balance and reduces histamine levels. Research shows it may improve sneezing, nasal congestion, and overall symptom relief.

## **Putting It All Together**

Seasonal allergies don’t have to take over your fall season! By combining allergen avoidance, a low-histamine, anti-inflammatory diet, and natural supplements, you can reduce sneezing, congestion, and fatigue—and actually enjoy this beautiful season. Everyone’s immune system responds differently, so finding the right mix may take a little trial and error, but the results are worth it!
