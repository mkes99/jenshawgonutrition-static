## **Nutritionist’s Notes**

This recipe provides a balanced blend of complex carbohydrates, plant-based protein, and healthy fats — all essential for steady energy and blood sugar balance. Pairing protein and fiber together in the morning helps regulate appetite and mood, and can prevent mid-morning energy crashes. This combination makes these oats a smart, balanced breakfast option for anyone with busy mornings or blood sugar goals.

### **Key Ingredients & Benefits**

* **Oats:** Rich in soluble fiber (beta-glucans) to support digestion and help maintain healthy cholesterol levels. They also provide sustained energy for busy mornings.
* **Peanut Butter Powder:** Offers the flavor and protein of peanuts with less fat and fewer calories — great for clients looking to increase protein without heaviness.
* **Chia Seeds:** Packed with omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and antioxidants. They absorb liquid to create a thick, pudding-like texture that keeps you full.
* **Soy Yogurt:** A dairy-free protein powerhouse that supports muscle repair and satiety. The probiotics in yogurt can also aid gut health.
* **Monk Fruit Sweetener:** A natural, zero-calorie sweetener derived from fruit — an excellent choice for reducing added sugars while keeping the recipe sweet and satisfying.

**Serving Suggestions**

* Add fresh berries, apples, or bananas for a boost of antioxidants and added natural sweetness.
* Drizzle with natural peanut butter or almond butter for extra richness.
* Sprinkle cacao nibs or dairy-free chocolate chips for a treat-like breakfast.

**Tips for Success**

* Use gluten-free oats to ensure this recipe fits gluten-free diets.
* Adjust consistency before serving — add a splash of plant milk if the oats are too thick.
