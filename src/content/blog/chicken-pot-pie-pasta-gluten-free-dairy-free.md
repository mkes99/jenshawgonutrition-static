### Quick Overview

- **Servings:** 4–6
- **Prep Time:** 10 minutes
- **Cook Time:** 25 minutes
- **Total Time:** 35 minutes

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons vegan butter
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 1 (12–16 oz) bag frozen peas and carrots blend
- 2 tablespoons gluten-free flour
- 1 cup unsweetened plant-based milk (almond or oat)
- 1 cup chicken bone broth
- 1 rotisserie chicken, deboned and chopped (about 2–2½ cups)
- 2 teaspoons chicken bouillon paste (*Better Than Bouillon* or similar)
- ½ teaspoon salt (or to taste)
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1 teaspoon marjoram
- ½ teaspoon thyme leaves
- 1 (8–12 oz) box Banza pasta, cooked and drained

## Instructions

### 1. Sauté Onion

In a large skillet or sauté pan, melt the vegan butter over medium heat. Add the diced onion and
cook until translucent, about 4–5 minutes.

### 2. Add Garlic and Vegetables

Stir in the minced garlic and the frozen peas and carrots. Cook for 5–6 minutes, until the
vegetables are tender and heated through.

### 3. Create a Roux

Sprinkle the gluten-free flour evenly over the vegetables. Stir to coat and cook for 1–2 minutes to
remove the raw flour taste.

### 4. Add Liquid and Thicken

Slowly pour in the plant-based milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Once incorporated,
gradually add the chicken bone broth and stir until the sauce begins to thicken, about 3–5 minutes.

### 5. Season and Add Chicken

Stir in the chicken bouillon paste, salt, pepper, parsley, marjoram, and thyme. Add the chopped
chicken and simmer for 8–10 minutes, allowing the flavors to come together.

### 6. Combine with Pasta

Add the cooked pasta and stir until evenly coated in the creamy sauce. Taste and adjust seasoning if
needed.

### 7. Serve

Serve warm, topped with a sprinkle of parsley for a fresh finish.

## Nutritionist’s Notes

This gluten- and dairy-free chicken pot pie pasta is a nourishing take on a comfort-food favorite.
Using Banza chickpea pasta keeps it higher in protein and fiber, while the plant-based milk and
vegan butter provide that classic creamy texture without any dairy.

The simple combination of peas and carrots adds antioxidants, vitamin A, and natural sweetness — all
while keeping the recipe quick and budget-friendly.

## Serving Suggestions

- Pair with a fresh green salad or roasted Brussels sprouts.
- For even more veggie goodness, stir in baby spinach or diced mushrooms during the onion step.

## Tips for Success

- Reheating: Add a few tablespoons of broth or milk before reheating to restore creaminess.
- Storage: Keeps well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
- Gluten-free: Double-check that your bouillon paste and broth are certified gluten-free.
